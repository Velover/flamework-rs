//! Networking (F5) end to end, through the real compiler on `tests/fixture_f5`: the packed call sites of every shape
//! (`fire`, `except`, `broadcast`, `invoke`, `invokeWithTimeout`, `setCallback` and the member called itself), every
//! mode (packed by `networking.serialization`, `Unreliable`, `Raw`, `Serialized`), the declarations' decoders and
//! middleware, arguments read where they are or bound, spreads, every place a call can stand (ahead of its statement,
//! in a function, in a `do` block past a function's or the file's budget of locals, including a function or file so
//! full of locals already that the packing is built as first built, `wide.ts` and `wideTop.ts`), nested sends, sends
//! in class members (`members.ts`: named in source order, which roblox-ts does not compile them in) and the client and
//! server sides (`crate::networking`).
//!
//! `tests/fixture_f5/expected` holds the TS5 pipeline's output (roblox-ts master with the published 2.0.0-beta.0
//! transformer) for every file but one, each compared whole (`chained.ts`: sends in an optional chain, in a function
//! that checks the chain's start, as TS5). The one differs from TS5's in shape only (README, Known limitations) and is
//! checked on its own: `scopedReturn.ts` has a returned send past its function's budget of locals, which flamework-rs
//! packs in a function where TS5 puts the statement in a block.
//!
//! The project is copied to a temporary directory with a `node_modules` as an install has it (`support::project`);
//! without the monorepo and the `@rbxts` packages the tests are skipped, saying so.
