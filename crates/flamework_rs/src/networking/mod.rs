//! Networking (`@flamework-experimental/networking`): the TS transformer's `transformNetworkingCall.ts`,
//! `util/functions/networkMode.ts` and `macros/intrinsics/networking.ts`.
//!
//! - **Call sites** ([`calls`]): a call that sends over a packed networking member (`fire`, `except`, `broadcast`,
//!   `invoke`, `invokeWithTimeout`, or the member called itself) packs its values where it is made and goes to the
//!   member's hidden `_fire` / `_except` / … entry point; `setCallback(cb)` registers the callback with a packer for
//!   its result (`_setCallback(cb, pack)`). The calls are claimed by the receiver's or callee's type (the
//!   `_flamework_packing` marker every handler member carries), then checked as the TS checks them.
//! - **Network declarations**: the `network-decoder` / `network-result-decoder` intrinsics (a decoder per packed
//!   member, [`crate::serializer::build_decoder`]), `network-unreliable`, and `intrinsic-middleware` ([`middleware`]),
//!   all reached through user macros ([`crate::macros`]).
//! - **Modes** ([`mode`]): how a member's markers and `networking.serialization` decide whether it is packed.
//! - **`explainRemovedNetworkMarker`** ([`mode::explain_removed_marker`]): TypeScript's error for a marker dropped before
//!   beta, as one naming the marker that replaces it.
//!
//! Every packing site of a file is planned and built when the file begins, with the file's serializers
//! ([`crate::serializer::prepare_serializers`]), in the TS transformer's order: they share the file's generated
//! helpers, whose names follow that order.
