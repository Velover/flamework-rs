//! `Plugin::setup` (the TS transformer's `TransformState` constructor and `setupBuildInfo`): the package, the config
//! and environment, the package build infos with the version check, the id settings, and the fresh `flamework.build`
//! with its keys created in DESIGN §10.4's order.
//!
//! Everything is read through the compiler ([`SetupCx::read_input`] / [`SetupCx::env`]), so every file and variable
//! read here is a build input.
//!
//! **The previous `flamework.build`** (the TS transformer's `buildInfoRead`). A clean build starts from a new one, as
//! a TS5 full build does: it rotates the salt and the build seed. Every other build reuses the last committed one, so
//! the files it does not transform keep their ids, salt, build seed and `Modding.Hash` seed:
//! - a watch rebuild that runs setup again: the committed [`FwState`], handed on in memory;
//! - an incremental build in a new process, and a watch rebuild whose state file was deleted or edited (the compiler
//!   hands a fresh state then): the file, read with [`SetupCx::read_persisted`] (`fromDirectory`, the project's own
//!   file only) and refused when it cannot be used, with the TS texts;
//! - a clean build the W1 harness seeds with a watcher's committed state (`rbxts_transform`'s
//!   `BuildSession::with_seed`).
//!
//! A reused one whose id mode or code-shaping config differs from this build's ([`build_info::changed_inputs`]) is
//! dropped for a new one, as a clean build makes it (new salt, build seed and hash seed). **This deviates from TS**,
//! whose `refuseChangedInputs` stops the build because it cannot make roblox-ts recompile every file; under rbxts-rs
//! those inputs are build inputs of setup, so a change already makes the compiler transform every file, and no file
//! keeps what the old inputs emitted. A reused one of another version stops at the project version check
//! ([`build_info::check_project_version`]). The `Shared` this makes holds a snapshot of it for the transform;
//! `finish` works from the state, which a watch rebuild that keeps the `Shared` has advanced since (DESIGN §14).
