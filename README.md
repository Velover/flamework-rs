# flamework-rs

Flamework's TypeScript transformer (v2, `@flamework-experimental/transformer`) ported to Rust, as a plugin compiled into
[rbxts-rs](#dependencies) (roblox-ts in Rust, on tsrs), plus `rbxtsc-fw`: the `rbxtsc` command line with Flamework
compiled in, the binary a Flamework project builds with.

- `crates/flamework_rs`: the plugin (ids, decorators and metadata, user macros and intrinsics, guards, the serializer,
  components, `flamework.build`, the include JSON) and the byte-exact libraries its output depends on.
- `crates/rbxtsc_fw`: the `rbxtsc-fw` binary. It takes roblox-ts's `build` arguments and returns its exit codes;
  Flamework is on for a project whose tsconfig lists `@flamework-experimental/transformer` in
  `compilerOptions.plugins`.

**Status:** work in progress, provided as is. Every part of the TS transformer is ported, networking included; where
the output may still differ, see [Known limitations](#known-limitations).

**Licence:** MIT (`LICENSE`). Parts are ports of Flamework, hashids, uuid, glob, minimatch and brace-expansion; their
notices are in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.

## Dependencies

rbxts-rs (the compiler and its plugin API, `rbxts_plugin`) and tsrs are git dependencies pinned by rev in the root
`Cargo.toml`. The tsrs URL and rev must be exactly the ones rbxts-rs's own `Cargo.toml` names at the pinned rbxts-rs
rev: Cargo does not enforce one copy of a git dependency, so a mismatch builds a second tsrs and fails only later, with
E0308 on a tsrs type. `bash tools/check-deps.sh` fails when any `tsrs_*` or `rbxts_*` crate is in the graph twice; run
it after changing a dependency, a `[patch]` or `Cargo.lock`. `Cargo.lock` started as a copy of rbxts-rs's.

## Build and test

The toolchain comes from `rust-toolchain.toml`. Dev builds are optimised (a debug checker is unusably slow).

```sh
cargo build --locked
cargo test --locked
bash tools/check-deps.sh
```

The end-to-end tests (`e2e`, `guards_e2e`, `macros`, `macros_env`, `serializer_e2e`) build fixtures with the real
compiler. They need the built Flamework v2 packages (a checkout of its monorepo with `packages/core/out` built:
`FLAMEWORK_RS_MONOREPO`) and the `@rbxts` packages `compiler-types`, `t` and `types` (a `node_modules/@rbxts`
folder: `FLAMEWORK_RS_RBXTS`). Without them they are skipped, saying so. The unit test that checks the embedded JSON
schemas against the transformer's reads the monorepo from `FLAMEWORK_MONOREPO`.

## Install

`rbxtsc-fw` is installed with Cargo from a pinned commit, one folder per Flamework version (the paths below are
examples; `<url>` stands for this repository's git URL):

```sh
cargo install --git <url> --rev <hash> rbxtsc_fw --root E:\Tools\rbxts\fw-2.0.0-beta.0
```

That gives `E:\Tools\rbxts\fw-2.0.0-beta.0\bin\rbxtsc-fw.exe`. The plain compiler from rbxts-rs (no Flamework) goes in a
folder of its own the same way, for example `E:\Tools\rbxts\rbxtsc\`.

- **A project** points its `package.json` build script at the folder that matches its `@flamework-experimental/*`
  version (`"build": "E:/Tools/rbxts/fw-2.0.0-beta.0/bin/rbxtsc-fw.exe build"`).
- **Upgrading** is changing that path and the npm packages together, to the folder of the new version.
- **Cleaning up** an old version is deleting its folder, or `cargo uninstall rbxtsc_fw --root <dir>`.
- **Where the build goes:** `cargo install` builds in a temporary target directory, removed afterwards, unless
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is set. A build in a checkout goes to `target/` (or `--target-dir`, or `[build] target-dir` in
  `.cargo/config.toml`), which `cargo clean` removes. Cargo's git and registry caches under `~/.cargo` (`git`,
  `registry`) are safe to delete; they are downloaded again when needed.
- The dev profile is optimised (`opt-level = 3`), so a checkout's `cargo build` gives a usable compiler too.

## Developing against a local rbxts-rs

To build against a local rbxts-rs checkout instead of the pinned rev, override the git source with path dependencies
in an uncommitted `.cargo/config.toml` (git-ignored), one line per rbxts-rs crate in `Cargo.lock`:

```toml
[patch."file:///E:/Projects/TS/Flamework/rbxts-rs"]
rbxts_cli = { path = "<rbxts-rs>/crates/rbxts_cli" }
rbxts_luau = { path = "<rbxts-rs>/crates/rbxts_luau" }
rbxts_luau_check = { path = "<rbxts-rs>/crates/rbxts_luau_check" }
rbxts_plugin = { path = "<rbxts-rs>/crates/rbxts_plugin" }
rbxts_project = { path = "<rbxts-rs>/crates/rbxts_project" }
rbxts_transform = { path = "<rbxts-rs>/crates/rbxts_transform" }
```

While it is on, Cargo rewrites `Cargo.lock` for the path sources, so `--locked` fails: build without it, and restore
`Cargo.lock` (`git checkout Cargo.lock`) when you remove the patch. The local checkout must name the same tsrs as this
workspace (`tools/check-deps.sh`). When the change lands in rbxts-rs, move the rev in `Cargo.toml` to it and update the
lock with `cargo update -p rbxts_plugin` (which moves every crate of that source).

## Parity

`tools/parity.cjs` builds a whole project with `rbxtsc-fw` and compares the output, file by file and byte for byte,
with a reference build of the same project (TypeScript 5 roblox-ts with Flamework's TS transformer):

```sh
node tools/parity.cjs <rbxtsc-fw exe> <project dir> <reference out dir> <work dir> [--report FILE] [--diff N] [--save-out DIR]
```

It copies the project into the work dir (without its `out`, `include` and build infos; links are kept as junctions),
builds it, and prints `build exit N` and `identical A, differing B, only ours C, only ref D` (`tools/compare.cjs`, also
usable on its own). The options are described at the top of `tools/parity.cjs`.

## Known limitations

Where flamework-rs's output may differ from Flamework's TS transformer (TypeScript 5) in ways it cannot detect:

- **Guard text of a mapped type over a union of keys** (`Pick<T, "b" | "a">`, `Omit`, `Record`, a key-remapping
  `as` clause, and a rest or spread of one): a guard lists its keys (`t.interface({ ... })`) in another order than
  TS5, which lists them in the order its checker first made the keys' literal types (it shifts with unrelated
  edits). The guard checks the same keys, so only the generated text differs, not what it accepts. Serializers of
  these types order their fields by the mapped type itself and are exact.
- **Order that depends on symbol ids.** A union that no written type orders (`Box<A | B>` reaching `value: T`) orders
  its members by a text of each type, and an object's text spells a unique-symbol key with the symbol's id
  (`__@sym@12`). Two keys whose texts agree up to the id (two unique symbols with the same name from different modules,
  or a user key `"__@zeta@1"` against a real `[zeta]`) are ordered by ids that differ between the compilers. TS5's own
  order there depends on its global symbol counter, so it can change with unrelated edits; give such unions a written
  order (a type alias of the union) instead.

Where it differs from TS5's output in shape only, with the same behaviour:

- **The order of a network's members.** The keys of a mapped type over `keyof T` (`incomingIds`, `outgoingIds`,
  `namespaceIds`, and the decoders built for them) are listed by a key of each, where TS5 lists them in the order its
  checker first made their literal types, which `keyof` does not fix (it shifts with unrelated edits). The arrays hold
  the members' names and remotes are matched by name, so their order carries no meaning: a server and a client built
  by the two compilers work together. The order the codecs are generated in and their names follow it.
- **A returned send past its function's budget of locals** (`return events.alpha.fire(x)` in a function that already
  holds many of Flamework's locals): the call and its packing go in a function, where TS5 puts the `return` statement
  in a block of its own with the packing.
- **A send in a `for` loop's incrementor** (`for (let i = 0; i < n; events.alpha.fire(i), i++)`): TS5's packing
  function makes roblox-ts see the loop variable captured and copy it per iteration (`local i = _i` … `_i = i`);
  flamework-rs's packing is not seen as a closure, so the loop has no copies. The function is called where it is made,
  so nothing can see the difference.

Where it differs on purpose:

- **A packed send followed by more of its optional chain** (`maybe?.fns.add.invoke(x).andThen(f)`): flamework-rs packs
  it inside the compiler's nil check, so the rest of the chain runs only when `maybe` is defined. TS5 does not build it:
  the function it wraps the send in returns `undefined` when `maybe` is, and the type check of its output refuses
  the rest of the chain on that (TS2532). A send that ends its chain (`maybe?.alpha.fire(x)`, the usual case) is
  compiled as TS5 compiles it.
- **Obfuscated keys through an optional chain** (`maybe?.alpha.fire(x)`, `f()?.ns.leaf.fire(x)` with
  `transformer.obfuscation`): flamework-rs obfuscates the member name as it does outside a chain. TS5 reads the key
  obfuscation marker off the receiver's type as it is, which may be `undefined` there, so it leaves the name as
  written and the send reaches no remote.
- **`middleware` written as a shorthand property, a method or an accessor** (`createServer({ middleware })`): a build
  error, as for any value that is not an object literal. TS5 fails an internal assertion.

What flamework-rs refuses that TS5 builds:

- **Spreading a map, an iterable function or a generator into a packed call's arguments** (`events.list.fire(...map)`):
  arrays, tuples, strings and sets are spread as roblox-ts spreads them; the rest is a build error. Spread the values
  into an array first (`[...map]`).
